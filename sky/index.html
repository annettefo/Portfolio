                    <p class="lead"> In my spare time, I enjoy exploring the world and making new memories. With my curious and adventurous spirit, I find myself exploring new ideas and places - attending hackathons to learn new technology, cooking new dishes for my friends and family, exploring new art museums, hiking along the coastline, and studying fashion.</p>
                    <p class="lead"> Programming allows me to have a balance of two very different worlds: a world of structure and a world of imagination. I get excited about exploring new ideas, opportunities in the integration of different disciplines, and seeing an idea come to life. If you want to collaborate on creating something exciting (disruptive technology or social impact), Iâ€™m open to it. I would love to hear from you! </p>

        <p> "Working with Annette was both a refreshing and challenging experience. She provided daily feedback on secondary projects while at the same time remained focused on weekly goals. She demonstrated the highest levels of professionalism, with members of my team indicating the weekly meetings she kept were creative, with gains or losses discussed in a frank but fair manner. Her attention to detail along with her years of experience proved to be valuable resources to us and I believe she will prove herself invaluable in whatever team she joins." <p>Alvin Patterson (Information Technology and Services Professional)</p>

        <p> "Annette's ability to focus, lead and motivate are unmatched. It was a privilege to see her work. Her leadership is seasoned well from her experience as a project manager and it shows when she participates in group projects and hackathons. She has a presence that exudes positivity. With her "can do" attitude, she's able to get things done on time. Her ability to listen and adapt to different roles of a team makes her valuable in any situation. During her free time, she enjoys educating herself on fine tuning her abilities or acquiring new skills. Annette is a hard worker and a rare find. She will do well wherever she goes." <p>Marllon Cantiga (Resident Engineer)</p></p>

        <p> "Annette is an incredibly driven and talented software developer. She is intelligent, ambitious, and tenacious. Annetteâ€™s background in project management compliments her ability to write great software; her insights translate into successful web development projects.

      <div>
        <p> "Annette is one of the hardest-working developers that I've had the pleasure of getting to know well. Having seen her conduct research and experiments, I can say that Annette is very dedicated and committed when it comes to mastering the intricacies of new skills. She has a thirst for knowledge and self-improvement that has led her to studying new technologies in order to incorporate into her projects. With a solid background as a project manager, Annette knows how to work well in fast-paced environments in order to lead her team to deliver products with strict deadlines. Her role as a leader with strong organization and presentation skills serves as motivation for her teammates to perform their best and has resulted in her team winning at hackathons. Annette always strives to improve herself as a person, which is a trait of a leader that will reflect well upon any team or company.

          "Annette is hardworking, focused, and disciplined. She is great to work with and has a mind that shoots ideas non-stop. I had the privilege of working with her and it was the best 2 years working in a call centre environment. Annette is a goal oriented individual that helps others to realize their true potential. I have no reservation recommending her to any organization/institution as I know the best is what she always puts forward, she will be a tremendous asset." <p>Taura Brown (Team Manager at Xerox Commercial Solutions)</p>

      <div>
        <p> "I worked with Annette during two projects and I was truly impressed by her personality and work ethic. Our programming team is very tight-knit, and a rigid personality could struggle to integrate with our flow; Annette, on the other hand, was quick to pick up on our pace and style, and had no trouble becoming a member of our group. Although her dynamism was admirable, it was her intelligence and drive that truly set her apart from the rest. Always eager to tackle new and more challenging tasks, Annette distinguished herself by seeking knowledge above and beyond what was required. This quality enabled her to work on problems above the expected level of an intern, and ultimately added significant and measurable value to our project. I honestly believe that Annette would be a positive addition to any development project." <p>Minh Ngoc Pham (Python Software Developer)</p>

        <p> "Ridiculously efficient and detailed is what comes to mind when I think about Annette. I had the pleasure of working with Annette for two plus years, collaborating on several small projects. Annetteâ€™s ability to juggle multiple tasks and attention to details was unlike any Iâ€™ve seen before and made a dramatic difference in the productivity level of our team and I still miss her at our meetings. As a team member or a leader, Annette earns my highest recommendation." <p>Gawaine Marshall (Managing Director at Marshall Arts Solutions)</p>

        <p> "I had the privilege of working closely with Annette on several projects while at Coding Dojo. She is a skilled developer with an incredible work ethic. We had worked closely on the TouchFace Project and she was a key player in its success. Iâ€™ve seen firsthand her dedication to her projects and her team as she had worked into the late hours of the night to get our project deployed. Through all of her work, she maintained a keen eye for detail whilst always having a contagiously positive attitude and great sense of humor. Sheâ€™s demonstrated a powerful drive in quickly picking up and learning new technologies while always offering a helping hand to help out her teammates. She's proven herself as a hard-worker and self-starter in many aspects. I can confirm, Annette demonstrated many key characteristics needed for the growth of a successful organization." <p> Andrew Balberchak (Full Stack Developer)</p>
